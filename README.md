# Sidecar

A minimalist yet huge jacket for [Simplify](http://mmth.us/simplify/). Due to the current inability to specify multiple sizes, this only works on 27" monitors.

If you'd like to hack around with this, see the [documentation on Github](https://github.com/mmth/simplify_jackets). Feel free to submit a pull request if you do something awesome. Or kind of awesome. Or a bugfix...
